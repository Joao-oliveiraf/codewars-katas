# If the first day of the month is a Friday, it is likely that the month will have an Extended Weekend.
# That is, it could have five Fridays, five Saturdays and five Sundays.
#
# In this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return:
#
# - The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend
# - The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year.
# For example:
#
# solve(2016,2020) = ("Jan","May",5). #The months are: Jan 2016, Jul 2016, Dec 2017, Mar 2019, May 2020

# TODO - Function to check if first day of given month it's a friday - use time lib
# TODO - Append to list -> Used to calculate how many months in interval meet the criteria 1st = friday (len of list)
# TODO - Return Tuple of list[0], list[-1], len(list)
